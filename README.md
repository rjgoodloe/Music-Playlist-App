# Music-Playlist-App

This is my second project from my CSE438 Android Development class.

The app uses the api at last.fm to get the current top tracks in the music charts.
Users can search for artist and songs. They can also find new artists and songs 
similar to the ones they enjoy.
Users can save songs to a playlist help in a local sql database.
